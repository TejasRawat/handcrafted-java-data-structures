# Handcrafted Java Data Structures 

This project contains **handcrafted implementations** of common data structures in Java.  
The goal is to build everything **from scratch** to understand how core classes like `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`, and `Queue` really work under the hood.

Instead of relying on `java.util.*`, I wrote my own **custom data structures** step by step 
like a "handmade" version of the Java Collections Framework.

##  Implemented Structures

-  `MyArrayList` (dynamic array)  
-  `MyLinkedList` (singly & doubly)  
-  `MyStack`  
-  `MyQueue`  

---

##  Why Handcrafted?
- To learn **internal working** of Java collections  
- To practice **time complexity analysis**  
- To appreciate design trade-offs (memory vs. performance)  
- To build a **custom learning library** for future reference
